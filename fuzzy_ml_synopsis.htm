<b>ased on the intuitionistic fuzzy sets and the possibility theory</b>. Fuzzy 
approach is fully utilized by using intuitionistic sets extended to represent 
not only <i>uncertain</i>, but also <i>contradictory</i> data within same 
framework. Consequently the results of the possibility theory are generalized 
for the case of contradictory data. Same as with the shades of uncertainty we 
introduce the shades of contradiction from feasible to infeasible. This allows 
us to operate uncertain and contradictory data in a unified, certain and
feasible way.</td>

<b>uzzy features</b>.
All the data the system operates on are considered 
fuzzy. For this a notion of fuzzy  feature is introduced as a generalization of 
crisp features known in classical machine learning. Similar to statistical 
pattern recognition, a feature is a measurable function with the 
possibility used as the measure. Both the features and the things viewed through 
features are consistently supposed fuzzy. By these  two ways  uncertainty 
comes into play. It might be a crisp thing described in vague terms, like a 
number being big or small. Or it can be a precise description of something 
uncertain, like a temperature said to be <i>n</i> degrees. There could be a 
mixture of both.</td>

<b>uzzy classes</b>. Within this framework classes take a natural

<b>umeric, enumeration features and features based on linguistic variables</b>. 
The system supports a variety of feature types:
<ul>
<li>Discrete features take values from some crisp finite enumeration set. For 
instance <i>red</i>, <i>green</i>, <i>blue</i>;</li>
<li>The numeric features with integer or real values. Because the system 
consistently rely on fuzzy approach, all numeric features may take standard 
numeric, interval and fuzzy numeric 
values;</li>
<li>Linguistic features taking values from a set of linguistic variables. 
Linguistic variables may be used to replace large domain sets of real numbers 
with finite sets of linguistic variables conceivable to human beings. 
Piecewise-linear shapes of membership functions supported, which includes 
triangular, trapezoid, shoulder etc.</li>

<b>lassifiers as features for building hierarchical systems</b>.
Because classes and features are treated in a unified 
way, the classifiers can be used as features which values yield 
classifications. This opens a door to building large hierarchical classification systems. 
In such a system 
output of a lower-level classification subsystem could be smoothly used for 
training higher levels of the system.</td>

<b>utomatic refinement in case of dependent features</b>. 
The problem of dependent features is well known as most difficult to solve. 
Although use of dependent features is less problematic in the possibility theory 
than in the probability theory. Because the result have a form of estimations 
which remains true no matter whether features involved are dependent or not. Yet 
the quality of the estimations may significantly drop. The system has a highly 
integrated mechanism of refinement of the estimations for dependent features 
known to be derived from other features. The approach is based on the 
constraints dynamically 
set on the feature values as the system navigates along the decision 
paths. The constraints are set and dropped fully transparent to the data base 
used for the teaching and classification.</td>

<b>ncremental learning</b>.
The way a training set is split into pieces does 
not affect the result of training. Further the classifiers can be continuously 
tuned on the fly as new training examples appear. Thus a classifier can be put 
into a controlling loop to act as an adaptive fuzzy controller.
